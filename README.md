# hott-lean-exercises

Hello! This is part of my "learning experience" project of formalization of (alternatives?) definitions and proofs of theorems and solutions to exercises of the HoTT book using the LEAN theorem prover.


Indeed, many definitions and proofs formalized here are already present in the HoTT library of Lean found in https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/hott/book.md

Most proofs and definitions here, are constructed independently though.
